weddinggiftdonations.com is a Web application that couple's getting married register with so that some of their wedding gifts are donations to nonprofit organizations.

Couple's traditionally create a wedding registry with stores to receive gifts when they get married, but some people would like to use this time of gift giving on their behalf to further a cause they care about rather than getting a blender or a drill.
